// =====================================================================================================================================================================
// 4  GRAPPLE JUMP - every number that shapes it, in the order it happens.
//
// WHAT HAPPENS, STEP BY STEP
//   1. You press and hold grapple. The hook lands after GROUND_DELAY / HOOK_DELAY (section 3).
//   2. When the hook lands on a FLOOR or SLOPE pivot while you are standing or rising (vy <= 0), a grapple jump starts. (Ledges, walls, ceiling, net and the ball never do.)
//   3. The rope's length is set to the REACH: how far from the pivot you will be pulled to (GJ_REACH_GROUND, capped at RANGE).
//   4. For GJ_DRIVE_T seconds the rope accelerates you away from the pivot. The pull is strongest at the start and fades out over the last GJ_EASE u before the reach.
//   5. After the window you coast on the speed you built; the rope goes taut at its length and the grapple float (section 5) holds you there.
//   Letting go of grapple at any point stops the pull on the spot (you keep whatever speed you have).
//
// HOW HIGH YOU GO depends on (a) the chain (how hard the pull is), (b) how much of the window you get (the pull stops once you are at the reach), and (c) the speed you already
// had when the hook landed (a regrab while rising adds to it, up to this jump's top speed).
// =====================================================================================================================================================================

// --- Reach: how far the rope pulls you out ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const GJ_REACH_GROUND = PL * 1.25;    // 40 u: how much FURTHER from the pivot than you are right now the rope reaches. Standing on the floor: rope = 16 + 40 = 56 u.
                                      //   The float sags a few u under the rope's length, so you settle with your feet about 1 PL off the platform. Raise = every jump goes higher
const GJ_REACH_WEIGHTED = 0.5;        // share of the reach you get when WEIGHT is held as the hook lands (0.5 = half as far: weight is a short, heavy hop)
const GJ_EASE = PL / 2;               // 16 u: the pull fades out over the last GJ_EASE u before the reach, so you glide in instead of slamming into the rope.
                                      //   Bigger = softer, floatier arrival but you stall a little short of the reach / 0 = full pull right up to the rope (overshoot + bounce)

// --- Strength: how hard the pull is -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const LIFT_V = 280;                   // u/s: the base speed of a grapple jump at full chain. The pull's top speed = LIFT_V x chain x (WEIGHT_M if weighted) x GJ_DRIVE_BOOST x air scale
const GJ_DRIVE_BOOST = 2.2;           // multiplier on that top speed (it exists so the pull can cover the reach inside the short window). First jump from the floor: 280 x 0.4 x 2.2 = ~246 u/s,
                                      //   a full chain: 616 u/s. The acceleration is top speed / GJ_DRIVE_T, so this scales the snap and the height together.
                                      //   THIS (and GJ_REACH_GROUND) is the "pop" you feel when a float is established: the pull overshoots the float point by ~16 u on a floor jump, then the rope reels you back
const WEIGHT_M = 1.2;                 // multiplier on the pull while WEIGHT is held as the hook lands (stronger, but see GJ_REACH_WEIGHTED: it reaches less far)
const GJ_DRIVE_T = 0.2;              // s: the window the pull runs for after the hook lands. Short on purpose: shorter = snappier and more all-or-nothing, longer = smoother and
                                      //   more forgiving (you can reach full speed from a later press). Pull strength = top speed / this, so lengthening it also softens each tick

// --- Latching while already high: weaker than a jump off the platform ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// When the hook lands far from its pivot (you are already up in the air, e.g. re-grabbing mid-bob), both the reach and the pull speed are scaled down:
// full strength when you are within GJ_NEAR u of the pivot, fading in a straight line to GJ_AIR_SCALE x strength by GJ_FAR u. A jump off the platform is always full strength.
const GJ_AIR_SCALE = 1;             // strength left when latching GJ_FAR u or more above the pivot (1 = no weakening, 0.5 = half the reach and half the pull, 0 = no jump at all up there)
const GJ_NEAR = PL;                   // 32 u: within this distance of the pivot you get the full jump. (Jumping with UP held lifts you a little before the hook lands: keep this above that)
const GJ_FAR = 3 * PL;                // 96 u: from this distance up you get the weakest jump (GJ_AIR_SCALE)

// --- Chain: spamming grapple jumps ramps the strength up ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// chain factor = min(GJ_MAX, GJ_START x GJ_GROWTH ^ n), n = grapple jumps already in the chain. Then it multiplies LIFT_V above.
const GJ_START = 1;                 // chain factor of the first jump (40% of full strength)
const GJ_GROWTH = 1.5;                // each further jump in the chain is 10% stronger than the one before (0.4, 0.44, 0.48, 0.53 ...)
const GJ_MAX = 1;                     // ceiling on the chain factor; with the numbers above it is reached on the 11th jump (0.4 x 1.1^10 = 1.04)
const GJ_CHAIN_T = 5;               // s: if this long passes since the last grapple jump landed, the chain resets to jump 1

// --- Direction ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const HOP_AIM = 0.5;                  // sideways share of the pull's direction. The pull points away from the pivot; the horizontal part is scaled by this, then it is renormalised.
                                      //   Pivot straight below: no effect (straight up). Pivot below-and-behind (slopes, standing off to the side): 1 = full diagonal, 0 = always straight up

// =====================================================================================================================================================================
// 5  GRAPPLE FLOAT & ROPE
// A surface rope is a LEASH: a maximum length, nothing more. Stretched past it, it acts as a spring that pulls you back; shorter than it, it is slack. On top of that, a
// "float" holds you above a floor pivot at the rope's length: below that point a second spring pushes you back up. The two together make the bob.

const KS = 100;                       // stiffness (force per u of stretch). Higher = snaps back harder and stops you sooner, so kicks and jumps overshoot less / lower = long, stretchy swings
const DAMP = 0.75;                     // damping while the rope is being STRETCHED (the way back is undamped on purpose, so the pull-back keeps its energy). Higher = overshoot dies out faster

const BOB_SOFT = 0.25;                // spring strength inside the bob zone (0.25 = a quarter as stiff). Lower = a softer, deeper sag

// --- The post-kick window (what a weight kick does to the float) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const DRIB_T = 0.45;                  // s: how long the post-kick window lasts (the bob zone is wider, and DRIB_FLOAT_FADE applies)

// =====================================================================================================================================================================
// 6  WEIGHT KICK (press WEIGHT while grappling): the bob
// Every press tries to throw you away from the pivot, about WEIGHT_KICK_REACH u past the float point. The rope then pulls you back like a rubber band: the further past the
// float point, the harder. You swing back, can sink a little under the float point on the momentum, and keep bobbing (damped by TAUT_DAMP) until you settle there.
// A press tops you up to the kick's speed rather than adding on top of what you have, and it fades out the further you already are, so spamming cannot snowball:

//   kick = EXPLODE_KICK_MIN (right at the edge) .. EXPLODE_KICK_MAX (dead centre), shaped by EXPLODE_FALLOFF (1 = linear, >1 = the strength stays low until it is really close).
// Amplify: a body that is already moving is pushed along its OWN motion, not just straight away from you, so exploding while you swing the ball makes the shot faster.
//   EXPLODE_AMP_BLEND = how far the push direction follows the body's motion (0 = always radial, 1 = fully along its motion), reached at EXPLODE_AMP_SPEED u/s;
