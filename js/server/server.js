// SERVER - serves the game files and runs online matches.  Start:  node server/server.js [port]     then open  http://localhost:8080/?room=test  in two tabs.
//
// Model (authoritative host): the server owns the real simulation, one per room. Clients send only their key presses; the server steps the sim at the game's fixed rate and
// sends everybody a snapshot of the whole world (saveState) 20 times a second (30 while playing at SNAP_EVERY=4), plus the one-off events (goals, impacts, bat hits) the renderer needs for its effects.
//
// Bandwidth savers (Render's free tier meters outbound traffic):
//   - SNAP_EVERY defaults to 6 (20 Hz). SNAP_EVERY=4 gives the old 30 Hz.
//   - Spectators / waiting players get every second snapshot.
//   - A room where nobody has pressed anything for IDLE_AFTER_MS, and where nothing moves, sends 1 snapshot a second.
//   - Delta encoding (clients that join with delta:true): every KF_EVERY snapshots is a KEYFRAME (the full world). In between, only the players' fields that differ from the keyframe are sent.
//     Deltas are relative to the keyframe, not to the previous snapshot, so a client that skips snapshots (backlog) can still apply any delta, as long as it holds the current keyframe.
//   - /health reports the measured snapshot traffic.
//
// Teams: a connection is on Blue (team 0), on Red (team 1) or waiting / spectating (team -1). A team has at most TEAM_MAX players. Seats are player ids: Blue sits in 0 then 2, Red in
// 1 then 3, in the order they joined the team. The first player into a room goes to Blue, the second to Red; everybody after that waits until the HOST (the player who made the room,
// passed on if they leave) moves them. The match runs only while both teams have a player (1v1, 1v2 and 2v2 all work); any change to who is seated restarts it.
//
// Protocol: JSON text messages over a WebSocket.
//   client -> server   {t:'join', room, special, lobby2v2, delta}  join a room; lobby2v2 = true only counts for the player who creates the room (they become the host); delta = true: send me delta snapshots
//                      {t:'in', n, k}                      my keys changed. n = my input counter, k = bit mask: l1 r2 up4 dn8 z16 x32 sp64 sp2 128.   (z = grapple, x = weight, sp = special)
