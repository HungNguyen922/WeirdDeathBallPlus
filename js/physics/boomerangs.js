// PHYSICS - boomerangs: the BOOMERANG special's projectiles. Never draws.
// Load order: after arrows.js (it reuses wrapAng and the arrow terrain lists) and before game/rules.js (which calls stepProjectiles()).
// Tuning numbers live in constants.js (BOOMERANG_*).
//
// One press throws a VOLLEY of BOOMERANG_VOLLEY boomerangs in a fan along the arrows held (none held: toward the net). Each one flies OUT along a curved, constant-speed arc until it has covered
// its range (the volley's ranges are staggered, so the wave is layered), then comes BACK: it keeps circling the same way it was thrown (so the path is a loop, not a U-turn) and homes in on its
// owner, turning harder the longer it takes, and is caught (removed) when it reaches them.
//
// DEFAULT: the arc bends UP first (over and around). Holding WEIGHT (keys.x) when you throw flips it: the arc bends DOWN first (under and around).
//
// PUSH: going out a boomerang is almost massless (BOOMERANG_M_OUT) so it barely moves what it touches. Coming back it is heavy (BOOMERANG_M_BACK), so whatever it meets on the return leg
// is shoved along with it, toward the owner. The outbound wave sails past an object, the return arc comes round the far side of it and drags it home.
// A boomerang never kills, its own path is not changed by what it hits, and its owner passes straight through it.

// Throw a volley from player p along the arrows held (hx, hy are -1 / 0 / 1; both 0 = toward the net).
// inv = flip the arc to bend downward first. Left out, it follows whether p is holding Weight. Returns how many were thrown (0 = already at BOOMERANG_MAX out).
