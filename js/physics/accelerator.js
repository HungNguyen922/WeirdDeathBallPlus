// PHYSICS - accelerator: the ACCELERATOR special. Never draws (see render/accelerator.js). Built on physics/statics.js; tuning numbers live in constants.js (ACCELERATOR_*).
// Load order: after statics.js and player.js, before game/rules.js.
//
// HOW IT PLAYS: press the special key to drop a node where you stand. Every node is joined by a line to each OLDER node of yours, so n nodes make n(n-1)/2 lines. At ACCELERATOR_MAX nodes the
// next press replaces your oldest. Nodes stay until the round ends (ACCELERATOR_LIFE = 0).
// WHO IS SPED UP: when something crosses one of YOUR lines it gains ACCELERATOR_BOOST of its velocity, once per crossing, if it is
//   - you (and, with ACCELERATOR_BOOST_TEAMMATES, your teammates), or
//   - the death ball or a decoy that you were the LAST to grapple (ball.lastGrab, set in Player.attach and kept after you let go, until somebody else grapples it or the round resets).
// Enemies, other people's balls and projectiles are not touched. Boosts stack per crossing; the ball's own speed cap (BALL_VMAX) still applies.
//
// CROSSING: no extra state is kept. Where a body was a tick ago is rebuilt from its velocity (x - vx * DT), and a body crosses a line when that short move cuts it. That is exact for
// free flight and close enough around bounces; a teleport (warp, portal, swap) moves the body without a matching velocity, so it is never counted as a crossing.
// A line is handled by its NEWER end, so each line is checked once per body per tick.
